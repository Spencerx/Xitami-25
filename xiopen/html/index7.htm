<P>Filters are
programs that are run with the (usually) HTML file as input.  You
can write filters in Perl, Awk, C, Rexx, or any other language that
can handle standard input/output streams.  Filters are a little
like CGI programs, except that they are invoked whenever a certain
type of file is requested.

<P>Each definition in this section consists of a file extension with a
leading dot and a command. The command may be with a full path, or without,
if the program is on the PATH. Xitami lets you run scripts directly under
OS/2 and Windows 95/NT, if you respect the header conventions noted in the
CGI section.

<P>You can pass any type of input file to a filter program, with the
restriction that it must be a text file. Binary files will probably not work
under MS-DOS-like file systems. Under Unix there is no difference between
text and binary files.
<P>Xitami supports filter programs in Perl, C, or any other language that
your system supports. A filter program runs when the HTML page is displayed,
unlike a CGI program, which runs when the user posts data from a HTML form.
An example of a filter program is PHP 3.0, which Xitami supports.

<P>To add your own filter programs, you add an entry in the [Filter] section
of the config file. A filter program is invoked whenever a file with the
appropriate extension is displayed.

<P>Filter programs need to respect the rules for CGI programs. That is, they
should generate the same type of header (Content-Type: text/html). Filter
programs also get the standard CGI environment, and are subject to the CGI
timeouts and other constraints set in the [CGI] section.

<P>When you POST to a filter program, the form data is supplied on the
standard input as for CGI programs.  When you use the GET method, the file
that is being filtered is provided on the standard input.
